# MATH 2530 Introductory Data Science

Ohio University, Spring 2023-24

This `gh-pages` branch is used for the [class website](https://data-ohio.github.io/MATH2530_Spring23-24/)

## Instructor notes:

* Github will build the website automatically when you `git push`.
* One is supposed to be able to [build and view locally](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll), but it is not working for me.
* In the week files in _modules/, using tabs instead of spaces will mess up the builded and that week will not show.
